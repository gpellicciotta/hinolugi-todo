# Todo List

A simple unit converter.

## Roadmap

### 1.0.0 
Simple means of converting between currencies and measurement units.
Just enter a number and the chosen conversions will be shown.

### 1.5.0
Enables adding/deleting conversions to be shown/used.
Remembers the chosen conversions locally.

### 2.0.0
Enables offline install.
Enables reordering the conversions.

### 2.1.0 (= Current Major Version)
Better mobile UI with amount entry at bottom.
Keep track of latest used amount.

### Roadmap for Next Major Version
Enable configuring a custom conversion.
Enable loading actual exchange rates.
Possibly split off the exchange rate conversion into a separate project.
