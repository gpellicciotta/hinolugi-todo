# Todo List

A simple todo list, using the browser's local storage to have some form of persistance.

## Roadmap

### 1.0.0 (= Current Major Version)
- Simple todo-list for adding, marking as done and deleting todo list items.

### 2.0.0
- Enables offline install.
- Allows re-ordering the todo items.

### Roadmap for Next Major Version
- Allow multiple named lists
- Allow triggering an event when an item gets checked
- Also still ensure datetime tags are shorter + synchronize every ... minute/hour ?
