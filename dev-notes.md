# Utils

Online tools and utilities that should offer quick help with very specific needs.


## Overall Goals

1. Create a set of simple utilities that all can work 100% offline and locally.
   If there is a server-component, it should be 100% optional.
2. Have a consistent styling and easy UI/UX that works on both mobile and desktop.
3. Learn about front-end technologies, but HTML, Javascript and CSS in particular.
   So also don't use any frameworks or introduce any 3rd party dependencies
   beyond maybe fonts and icons.
